The Illustris Simulation: Public Data Release

Example code (Python).

See the [Illustris Website Data Access Page](http://www.illustris-project.org/data/) for details.

# Note: private version.

This version has a multi-threaded group catalog load (by default). Useful as it is much faster.

It also has some advanced hooks to enable various external functionality.

Can be used in exactly the same way as the public version.

# Install


```
git clone git@github.com:illustristng/illustris_python.git
cd illustris_python
pip install .
```
